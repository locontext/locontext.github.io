												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Boletus pallidus</i> (Kuo) </h3>
												<p>Pileus: 25-50 mm, parabolic, decurved margin, off-white and creamy, bruises blue, glabrous, margin even, context fleshy, thickest at center, gradually thinner towards margin. Lamelleae: Pores, ascending adnate attachment, narrow and slightly broad towards margin, pores small, spongy, dark interior, creamy yellow, even sizes. Stipe: 30-60 mm, central, equal, broad base, longitudinal gray streaks, otherwise white, bruises blue, slightly lacunose, fibrous, soft center. 
													Spore Print: Reddish, tan
													Habit: Gregarious, all from one cluster, terrestrial, near decaying wood, nearest to Oak. 
													Justification: Unlike many other polypores, this species bruised blue while also displaying a creamy yellow pore surface, narrowing down the genus to Boletus. The closely related Caloboletus inedulis has similar features to this B. pallidus. However the C. inedulis stipe has reddish tones near the base and tastes distinctly bitter. This collection displayed white stems and did not have a strong taste.</p>

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Amanita citrina</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 50-60 mm mature, 25-30 mm young, convex to plane, decurved margin, straightening with age, creamy white, tan center; surface dry, smooth, margin striate; context dry, center thick, none at margin; earthy scent, neutral flavor.Lamellea: Adnexed to sinuate, narrow, average, closely spaced; even, dry waxy, equal, branching at margin; white.Stipe: 50-100 mm x 5-10 mm, central, terete, rounded, collared bulb; tan, gray towards base, white at apex; fibrous, solid. Annulus: Creamy white, membranous, subperonate, retained on stipe. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Solitary, scattered a few feet from eachother, emerging from oak and pine leaf litter, near oak, pine, beech. 
													
													Justification: This Amanita was found with features similar to A. porphyria, common on the Pacific coast. Key features that helped identify this sample as A. citrina include the stipe dimensions, pale yellow pileus, and collared bulb. A. citrina has a narrow and shorter stipe compared to A. porphyria. The pale colored cap help differentiate this sample further from the closely related A. brunnescens, which is known for a grayish brown cap.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Hygrophorous eburneus</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 25-55 mm, plane center, convex near margin, circular to rounded triangle disk; margin decurved, even; evenly creamy white, slimy, smooth; context 1-2 mm throughout, tapered at margin, soft, fleshy; fresh and sweet odor, neutral taste. Lamellae: short decurrent, narrow, average, close to crowded, even, equal; soft, white. Stipe: 40-60 mm, central, terete, longitudinally striate at apex,  smooth and broad at base, pliable, solid with narrow hollow center. 

													Spore Print: Buff
													
													Habit: Two clusters of 2-3 connately fused mushrooms, emerging from soil near decaying wood. Beech trees nearest, oaks nearby.		
													
													Justification: This waxy cap was growing in an Oak-Beech area, with no pine trees nearby. The cap and stem were both viscid, cap especially slimy (light rain at the time). Unlike L. illinita, the gills are not free but rather shortly decurrent and the stipe was viscid. This sample also was differentiated from H. glyocyclus and H. piceae because of its almost purely white cap and the absence of conifers nearby.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Thelophora palmata</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Fruiting Body: Coral shape, multiple stipes with splitting ends, some branching stems with split ends; surface smooth, dry, pale gray, purple-gray with age.

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habitat: Scattered, terrestrial, growing among oak. 
													
													Justification: This mushroom looks very similar to a coral, however the flattish branches and roughly split tips indicate this species is Thelophora palmata.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Cantharellus cibarius</i> (Fries)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 30-80 mm, depressed; orange, dry, fleshy, smooth; undulating, slightly uplifted margin; context dry, thicker towards center, firm; no odor. Lamallae: Long decurrent, narrow at margin, broad at center, thick, even, forking. Stipe: 10-50 mm, central, equal, smooth.

													Spore Print: creamy yellow
													
													Habit: Growing terrestrially scattered in a pine forest. 
													
													Justification: These chanterelle mushrooms were found growing under white pine trees. The long, forking decurrent gills and firm, golden cap surface are indicative of true chanterelles. There was no odor when picked, also consistent with southeastern US distributions of chanterelles.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Entoloma aboritivum</i> (Berk & Curtis)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-70 mm, convex, pale white, tinge of blue, smooth; decurved, even margin; context fleshy, firm; sweetish odor. Lamallae: Short decurrent, narrow, average, close, even, forking. Stipe: Central, equal, slightly punctate, firm.

													Spore print: Salmon pink
													
													Habit: Growing caespitose, from soil under moss, with aborted Armillaria mellea fruitbodies near the base of the cluster. 
													
													Justification: The genus Enteloma was characterized by the attached gills, terrestrial growth, and salmon spore print. This Enteloma is distinctively recognized by the aborted fruiting bodies of A. mellea found scattered near the growth.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Cuphophylus virgineus</i> (Wulfen)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-30 mm, convex to plane, white with grey tinge, smooth, viscid; margin even, decurved to straight. Lamellae: short decurrent, narrow, average, forking, subdistant, especially at center. Stipe: 60-100 mm, equal, flexuous, smooth, dry, pliable. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Three individuals scattered a few inches apart, emerging from soil, much of the stipe hidden under leaf matter. 
													
													Justification: Synonymous genus names are Hygrocybe, Camarophyllus, and Hygrophorus. These waxy caps are characterized by a viscid cap and dry stipe surface, gills continuing to the stipe, and a white spore print. All three fruiting bodies displayed this morphology, and they can be differentiated from the closely related Cuphophyllus borealis by displaying a slightly viscid cap instead of a sticky cap.
