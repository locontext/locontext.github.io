												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Boletus pallidus</i> (Kuo) </h3>
												<p>Pileus: 25-50 mm, parabolic, decurved margin, off-white and creamy, bruises blue, glabrous, margin even, context fleshy, thickest at center, gradually thinner towards margin. Lamelleae: Pores, ascending adnate attachment, narrow and slightly broad towards margin, pores small, spongy, dark interior, creamy yellow, even sizes. Stipe: 30-60 mm, central, equal, broad base, longitudinal gray streaks, otherwise white, bruises blue, slightly lacunose, fibrous, soft center. 
													Spore Print: Reddish, tan
													Habit: Gregarious, all from one cluster, terrestrial, near decaying wood, nearest to Oak. 
													Justification: Unlike many other polypores, this species bruised blue while also displaying a creamy yellow pore surface, narrowing down the genus to Boletus. The closely related Caloboletus inedulis has similar features to this B. pallidus. However the C. inedulis stipe has reddish tones near the base and tastes distinctly bitter. This collection displayed white stems and did not have a strong taste.</p>

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Amanita citrina</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 50-60 mm mature, 25-30 mm young, convex to plane, decurved margin, straightening with age, creamy white, tan center; surface dry, smooth, margin striate; context dry, center thick, none at margin; earthy scent, neutral flavor.Lamellea: Adnexed to sinuate, narrow, average, closely spaced; even, dry waxy, equal, branching at margin; white.Stipe: 50-100 mm x 5-10 mm, central, terete, rounded, collared bulb; tan, gray towards base, white at apex; fibrous, solid. Annulus: Creamy white, membranous, subperonate, retained on stipe. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Solitary, scattered a few feet from eachother, emerging from oak and pine leaf litter, near oak, pine, beech. 
													
													Justification: This Amanita was found with features similar to A. porphyria, common on the Pacific coast. Key features that helped identify this sample as A. citrina include the stipe dimensions, pale yellow pileus, and collared bulb. A. citrina has a narrow and shorter stipe compared to A. porphyria. The pale colored cap help differentiate this sample further from the closely related A. brunnescens, which is known for a grayish brown cap.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Hygrophorous eburneus</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 25-55 mm, plane center, convex near margin, circular to rounded triangle disk; margin decurved, even; evenly creamy white, slimy, smooth; context 1-2 mm throughout, tapered at margin, soft, fleshy; fresh and sweet odor, neutral taste. Lamellae: short decurrent, narrow, average, close to crowded, even, equal; soft, white. Stipe: 40-60 mm, central, terete, longitudinally striate at apex,  smooth and broad at base, pliable, solid with narrow hollow center. 

													Spore Print: Buff
													
													Habit: Two clusters of 2-3 connately fused mushrooms, emerging from soil near decaying wood. Beech trees nearest, oaks nearby.		
													
													Justification: This waxy cap was growing in an Oak-Beech area, with no pine trees nearby. The cap and stem were both viscid, cap especially slimy (light rain at the time). Unlike L. illinita, the gills are not free but rather shortly decurrent and the stipe was viscid. This sample also was differentiated from H. glyocyclus and H. piceae because of its almost purely white cap and the absence of conifers nearby.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Thelophora palmata</i> (Aurora)</h3>
												<p>Fruiting Body: Coral shape, multiple stipes with splitting ends, some branching stems with split ends; surface smooth, dry, pale gray, purple-gray with age.

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habitat: Scattered, terrestrial, growing among oak. 
													
													Justification: This mushroom looks very similar to a coral, however the flattish branches and roughly split tips indicate this species is Thelophora palmata.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Cantharellus cibarius</i> (Fries)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 30-80 mm, depressed; orange, dry, fleshy, smooth; undulating, slightly uplifted margin; context dry, thicker towards center, firm; no odor. Lamallae: Long decurrent, narrow at margin, broad at center, thick, even, forking. Stipe: 10-50 mm, central, equal, smooth.

													Spore Print: creamy yellow
													
													Habit: Growing terrestrially scattered in a pine forest. 
													
													Justification: These chanterelle mushrooms were found growing under white pine trees. The long, forking decurrent gills and firm, golden cap surface are indicative of true chanterelles. There was no odor when picked, also consistent with southeastern US distributions of chanterelles. 
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Entoloma aboritivum</i> (Berk & Curtis)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-70 mm, convex, pale white, tinge of blue, smooth; decurved, even margin; context fleshy, firm; sweetish odor. Lamallae: Short decurrent, narrow, average, close, even, forking. Stipe: Central, equal, slightly punctate, firm.

													Spore print: Salmon pink
													
													Habit: Growing caespitose, from soil under moss, with aborted Armillaria mellea fruitbodies near the base of the cluster. 
													
													Justification: The genus Enteloma was characterized by the attached gills, terrestrial growth, and salmon spore print. This Enteloma is distinctively recognized by the aborted fruiting bodies of A. mellea found scattered near the growth.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Cuphophylus virgineus</i> (Wulfen)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-30 mm, convex to plane, white with grey tinge, smooth, viscid; margin even, decurved to straight. Lamellae: short decurrent, narrow, average, forking, subdistant, especially at center. Stipe: 60-100 mm, equal, flexuous, smooth, dry, pliable. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Three individuals scattered a few inches apart, emerging from soil, much of the stipe hidden under leaf matter. 
													
													Justification: Synonymous genus names are Hygrocybe, Camarophyllus, and Hygrophorus. These waxy caps are characterized by a viscid cap and dry stipe surface, gills continuing to the stipe, and a white spore print. All three fruiting bodies displayed this morphology, and they can be differentiated from the closely related Cuphophyllus borealis by displaying a slightly viscid cap instead of a sticky cap.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Phlebia incarnata </i> (Scheinich)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 10-50 x 5-30 mm, flabelliform, pink, smooth, short/soft velvety; widely spaced crenate, decurved margin; context fleshy, dry, pliable. Lamellae: narrow, veined, toothed towards attachment, rigged towards margin, white, dry. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Saprotrophic, growing on decaying wood, fruiting along one half of the log, bracket clusters spaced at least one foot apart. 
													
													Justification: This common bracket fungus is found throughout hardwood-conifer forests in the Southeastern US. Recently changed to the genus Phlebia, this species is known to cause white rot on both hardwoods and conifers and the fruiting bodies were dry not jelly.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Xylaria polymorpha</i> (Persoon)</h3>
												<p>Fruiting Body: 20-40 x 10-25 mm, dry, rough, black, unequal, lumpy; hard, hollow interior. 

													Spore Print: Dark Brown
													
													Habit: Sapotrophic, four individual fruiting bodies, scattered along decaying branch. 
													
													Justification: This dull tuft of black fruiting bodies is distinctive for the genus Xylaria. The closely related X. longipes is smaller, slimmer and not as tough as X. polymorpha. 
													
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Coprinellus micaceus </i> (Bulliard)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 10-50 x 5-20 mm, cylindric to parabolic, light brown at apex turning grayer towards margin, rugulose; margin plicate and splitting, straight; context thin, frail. Lamellae: Free, narrow, average, crowded, black, even, deliquescent, unequal. Stipe: 30-75 mm, central, flexuous, pliable, hollow. 

													Spore Print: Black
													
													Habit: Clustered in many groups, growing from soil tucked under a log. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: These mushrooms were identified under Coprinellus because of the deliquescence in mature fruiting bodies. Due to the gregarious growth habit, pleated pileus and striate margin, C. micaceus, C. impatiens, and C. disseminatus are all closely resemble these mushrooms. However, due to the longer stipe than C. impatiens, and crowded lamellae unlike C. disseminatus, C. micaceus is the best description for this collection.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Pleurotus ostreatus </i> (Kummer)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-40 x 5-10 mm, flabelliform, smooth; uplifted and even margin; context fleshy, thin, firm. Lamellae: Decurrent, narrow, average, close, even, soft, unequal. Stipe: absent, attachment to log. 

													Spore Print: Lilac
													
													Habit: Scattered far apart, shelving along log in a ditch. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: The lilac spore print, soft fleshy fruiting body, and growth from a decaying log help identify the genus as Pleurotus. P. ostreatus is a common Pleurotus which is known for having white gills and a white/gray pileus. It is easily distinguishable from other Pleurotus species because of the substrate and distribution. Unlike the similar P. cornucopiae, these were found in Eastern North America. In our area there is a closely related P. porrigens, which is found on conifers instead of hardwood as in P. ostreatus.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Pycnoporus cinnabarinus</i> (Jacquin)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 30-60 x 5-30 mm, dimidiate, faded orange, dry, tough, rough; margin entire, unevenly lobed in small fruits, sweet smell. Pores: free from base, narrow, 1-4 pores per 1 mm, arid, rich orange color, almost cinnamon. Stipe: absent, attached to log. 

													Spore print: White
													
													Habit: Growing in scattered clusters along fallen log. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: This colorful polypore belongs to the genus Pycnoporus based on the brightly colored orange fruiting body and pores underneath. Differentiating P. cinnabarinus from other species in this genus is based on a comparison of morphological traits. Unlike P. sanguineus, all of the fruit in this collection are at least 5 mm in depth or greater. Unlike Aurantioporus croceus, the fruiting body is dry and tough instead of being more fleshy and fragile.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Russula mairei</i> (Schaeffer)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 20-40 mm x 5-10 mm, convex when young becoming plane towards maturity, deep red, dull dry, smooth; margin even, context white, compact, breaking cleanly. Lamellae: Closely free, narrow, close, smooth, even, equal. Stipe: Central, terete, smooth, less dense in middle but not hollow. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Growing scattered in a lawn under an oak tree. Habitat: Residential lawn, one large Quercus alba. 
													
													Justification: This common Russula was found growing directly above the root system of an isolated White Oak tree. Unlike the similar R. emetica, this collection was definitely growing under a hardwood and there are no conifers close-by. Another closely related species to differentiate from is R. silvicola, however this collection was not colored any shade of yellow.

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Lycoperdon pyriforme</i> (Schaeffer)</h3>
												<p>Fruiting Body: Round, tapering to a cylindric shape towards the base, hole near the apex at maturity, surface dull dry, papery, pliable but returning to original shape, light brown. Base: Sterile, firm, outer surface similar to the rest of the fruiting body. 

													Spore Print: Olive brown
													
													Habit: Growing within moss on rotting log, some solitary, mostly in a cluster large enough to form a mat of fruiting bodies. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: This is a common puffball, but can be differentiated from similar species such as L. pedicellatum which grows with spines on the surface and has a taller fruiting body. The brown coloration also distinguishes this species from the dark brown to black L. foetidum.

												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Lactarius vinaceorufescens</i> (Smith)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 30-40 x 5 mm, depressed, tannish brown, zones of darker brown, dry, shiny (holding water), smooth; margin entire, straight. Lamellae: Short decurrent, narrow, subdistant, even, soft, mostly equal. Stipe: 20-30 mm, central, terete, vertical wrinkles in mature mushrooms, firm, lighter tan than cap. 

													Spore Print: White
													
													Habit: Growing scattered in mixed forest, terrestrial, abundant. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: Lactarius is distinguishable because of the milk that appear when damaged and white spore print. This Lactarius is distinctive based on the changing color of ‘milk’ that exuded from breaks in the flesh. L. chrysorheus is also common and very similar in appearance to L. vinaceorufescens, however can be ruled out due to the darker color brown of this collection and the fading color of the milk. 
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Hypomyces lateritius</i> (Fries)</h3>
												<p>Description: Parasitic ascomycete growing on the gills of many Lactarius. Gills appear smooth to dimpled, creamy yellow-green. Due to the proximity to a collection of L. vinaceorufescens (RAR18), the fugus in this collection was likely living off this species. 

													Habit: Host growing scattered in mixed forest, terrestrial, abundant. Habitat: Oak-Hickory forest dominated by Quercus, Fagus, Juniperus, Carya. 
													
													Justification: This parasitic fungus is included in the genus Hypomyces because of its growth on the gills of Lactarius fruiting bodies. The closely related and recognizable H. lactifluorum also grows in a similar fashion, however is colored reddish orange. This collection is lighter colored, creamy yellow with a tinge of green. 
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa-comment"><i>Ganoderma applanatum</i> (Persoon)</h3>
												<p>Pileus: 115 x 50 mm, flabelliform, plane, surface rough, muddy brown to white at the margin, zones differentiating color; margin entire and straight. Pores: very small pores, fresh surface white, staining brown when marked, hard surface. Lamellae: absent.

													Spore Print: Brown
													
													Habit: Growing solitary on dead or dying oak. 
													
													Justification: This polypore is distinctive to the Ganoderma genus because of its white pore surface and woody growth on hardwoods. The distinguishing feature of this mushroom compared to that of G. lucidum is that the pore surface has only a white to brown staining color, no yellow is present and there is no stipe present.
